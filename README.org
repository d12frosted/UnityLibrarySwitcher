* Unity Library Switcher

Unity Library Switcher is a Unity3d plugin for switching build targets and git branches without the burden of assets reimporting.

** Install

To install the plugin just copy =src/UnityLibrarySwitcher/UnityLibrarySwitcher= folder to your project assets folder. Just don't forget to add this folder to =.gitignore= file. 

** How it works

You have two actions:

1. switch build target
2. switch git branch

Both actions are available from the plugin window, which is accessible from =Window/Library Switcher= menu.

=Library= folder is cached for every =(branch, target)= pair. When you perform any action, the plugin will cache =Library= folder for current =(branch, target)= pair and then replace =Library= folder by the cached library of selected =(branch, target)= pair if it exists. To make things work faster plugin copies =Library= folder only in case you are moving to the =(branch, target)= pair that wasn't cached before. If it was already cached, then plugin just moves directories around. All cached =Library= folders are stored in =LibrarySwitcherCache= folder in unity project root directory. =(branch, target)= pair's =Library= folder is stored at =LibrarySwitcherCache/branch/target=. 

** Limitations

- Due to the implementation details you should change build target or git branch only from the plugin window. Otherwise you will run into unnecessary imports.
- Branch switching only works with locally existing branches.
